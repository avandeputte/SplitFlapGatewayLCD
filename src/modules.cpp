// modules.cpp -- the module protocol: how a character, an index or a home becomes a frame.
//
// There is no module REGISTRY here any more, and that absence is the point. A registry is
// how the physical gateway learns what is out on its wire, where modules can be added,
// removed, renumbered or simply fail to answer. On this board the wall is DRAWN: vmods[] is
// created whole by vmInit() from rows x cols, every module exists, none can vanish, and
// vmods[i].curIndex is the flap on show -- not a report about it. A second copy of that
// truth could only ever be a worse one, and it was: it stored a BYTE where the truth is a
// flap index, so a quiet-time cycle folded "Hello world" into "HELLo worLD" and lost every
// pictograph on the wall. See sfSetQuietTime() below.

#include "gateway.h"
#include "canvas.h"
#include "sound.h"   // soundStop() when Quiet Time turns on (v3.6)

// Send one flap character. `c` is a single Windows-1252 byte: ASCII 0x20-0x7E, or a high
// byte (euro/accents/smart punctuation) -- see charset.h. Bytes that aren't a valid flap
// glyph (controls, undefined slots, NBSP/soft-hyphen) are dropped.
//
// The reel's glyph section is printed in capitals -- like a real one -- so lowercase must
// fold to its uppercase flap or it will not resolve. The seven colour codes are the
// exception: r o y g b p w are lowercase BY PROTOCOL, not letters, and folding them would
// turn red into the letter R.
//
// That fold is the legacy wire protocol's, and it is inescapable there: one byte per
// character, and seven of the letters already mean colours. The reel HAS lowercase flaps
// (and pictograph flaps) -- they are simply unreachable from this path. POST /api/display/cells
// addresses them by index, which is the only reason that endpoint exists. See reel.h.
//
// cp1252ToUpper() is the single definition of the fold (charset.cpp), and the reel is BUILT
// by excluding exactly what cp1252IsLower() accepts -- so the two cannot drift apart.

// into its pending slot, then one broadcast home drives every reel to the blank flap -- the
// same operation as the Home All button. The snapshot is what makes the blanking safe to
// undo: the falling edge replays it.
//
// ORDER MATTERS. The home must go out BEFORE gQuietTime is raised: frameSend suppresses
// display motion ('-', '+' and 'h') while quiet is on, so blanking after the flag would
// suppress the very frame that does the blanking.
//
// FALLING edge (on -> off): every module goes back to its pending flap -- what the host last
// asked for while quiet, or what it was showing when quiet began.
//
// THE SNAPSHOT IS A FLAP INDEX, NOT A CHARACTER, and that is the whole point of it. It used
// to live in the module registry as a byte, and the restore re-sent that byte through
// sfSendChar() -- straight back through the uppercase fold above. A wall reading
// "Hello world!er?" came out of a quiet-time cycle reading "HELLo worLD!Er?", and a
// pictograph, which has no byte at all, did not come back at all. A byte cannot name a flap
// on a 237-flap reel. An index can.

// the lock around vmDispatch and would self-deadlock. Snapshot under the lock, send
