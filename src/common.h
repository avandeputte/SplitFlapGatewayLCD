/*
 * Matrix Portal Gateway
 * Firmware for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-RGB-Matrix driver board driving a HUB75
 * RGB LED matrix. (Originally built on the Adafruit MatrixPortal S3; that
 * board's final version, v1.25.0, lives on the `matrixportal` git branch.)
 *
 * A port of the Split-Flap Gateway (v3.1) that keeps the entire gateway -- web UI,
 * REST API, OTA, command monitor -- and replaces
 * the physical gateway's serial transceiver with an in-process frame link and
 * a panel full of *virtual* split-flap modules. Nothing is wired to a real reel: every module the gateway
 * drives is emulated in firmware and drawn as a flap cell on the LED matrix.
 *
 * The emulation is at the PROTOCOL level, not the API level. Commands are framed,
 * sanitized and "transmitted" exactly as before; the virtual modules parse those
 * bytes and reply with real protocol frames, staggered the way the physical
 * modules' replies would be. The gateway cannot tell the difference, so the
 * companion app keeps working unchanged.

 * Split-flap module hardware and the initial protocol by Adam G Makes
 * (YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@AdamGMakes).
 *
 * Emulated protocol (module firmware v31, backward-compatible to v6):
 *   Frame format: m<ADDR><CMD>[data]\n
 *   Address:      decimal (zero-padded 2-digit v6 style, or variable-length v7+)
 *                 broadcast: m** (v6) or m* (v7+), optional range m*v<lo>-<hi>
 *                 by serial: mX...
 *   Commands the virtual modules ACT ON (vmDispatch):
 *                 m<id>-<char>    display character
 *                 m<id>+<n>       display by flap index
 *                 m<id>h          home
 *   Nothing replies. The physical protocol's query commands ('v' version,
 *   'A' all-fields) and by-serial addressing were removed in v1.24 -- no
 *   client ever sent them, and the wall self-describes through
 *   /api/capabilities and /api/display/state. The calibration/dump grammar
 *   is likewise unmodelled. All such frames pass the sanitizer untrimmed and
 *   the virtual modules silently ignore them, like any unknown command.
 *
 * Board: Waveshare ESP32-S3-RGB-Matrix (32MB octal flash @1.8V, 16MB octal
 *        PSRAM, PCF85063 battery RTC, TF slot, QMI8658 IMU, ES8311 audio --
 *        of which this firmware uses the RTC; the rest is future headroom)
 * Libraries: none for the panel -- see panel.cpp, a direct LCD_CAM + GDMA driver.
 *            ArduinoJson.

/* ---- This board's unique id -------------------------------------------------------
   Derived from the NIC-specific half of the MAC (bytes 3..5) -- the only part that
   actually differs between two boards.

   NOT ESP.getEfuseMac() masked, which is the trap this exists to close.
   esp_efuse_mac_get_default() writes the six MAC bytes in NETWORK order, and Arduino's
   EspClass reads that same buffer straight back as a LITTLE-endian uint64 -- so the LOW
   bytes of the value it returns are the OUI (48:27:e2), which is identical on every
   Espressif chip ever made. Masking the low 24 or 32 bits therefore hands EVERY board
   the same "unique" id.

   That is not theoretical. Two of these gateways on one LAN both derived the hostname
   splitflap-gw-e22748 and both connected to MQTT as splitflap-20E22748 -- and a broker
   evicts the client already holding a duplicate id, so the pair knocked each other
   offline in a loop, forever.                                                          */

/* ---- HUB75 matrix pins ----
   Waveshare's own map for this board (shipped in their patched
   ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA example: esp32s3-default-pins.hpp + the .ino's
   gpio.e override). The octal PSRAM consumes GPIO 33-37, so nothing here may
   touch that range -- and none of these collide with the board's I2C (47/48),
   I2S audio (12/21/38/39/43), SD (1/14/17/44) or BOOT button (0).

   The address list carries all five lines; the panel height decides how many
   are actually clocked, so a 1/16-scan 32-row panel simply never drives E.

   All 13 signals route through the GPIO matrix into one LCD_CAM data word
   (panel.cpp), so the map is arbitrary as far as the driver is concerned. */

/* How much internal SRAM the panel may take, and how much it must leave behind.
   dispInit() runs before WiFi.begin() so Protomatter^W panel.cpp gets first claim on
   the internal DMA pool -- but WiFi and lwIP allocate their RX/TX buffers from that
   same pool moments later, and nothing else in the firmware defends it. The settings
   page happily accepts 256x64 at depth 6, which is 242 KB of double-buffered
   framebuffer plus descriptors; that leaves the network stack on fumes, and the
   failure does NOT look like a panel fault. It looks like TCP connects failing
   (MQTT rc=-2), a web UI that stalls, and loop()'s 20 KB heap floor rebooting the
   board. panelBegin() first clamps the bit depth down until the framebuffer fits
   (v1.17.1) and refuses outright only if even depth 1 breaches a bound.

   BUDGET is the ceiling on the panel itself; RESERVE is what must still be free
   afterwards for WiFi/lwIP to come up. Both are internal-DMA-capable bytes.
   The 128x32 depth-4 default costs ~38.6 KB, so there is room to grow. */

// transient (PSRAM alloc + panel takeover, or a ~48 KB response stream) onto a stressed heap and
// risk loop()'s 20 KB reboot floor. 2x the floor: a genuinely-low signal, not a normal dip. A big

/* ---- Flip animation ----
   Changing the displayed flap cascades forward through the reel, which is what
   makes the panel read as a split-flap. It is a rendering effect, not a mechanism.

   FLAP_ANIM_MAX bounds one change to 64 flips (64 * DEFAULT_FLAP_MS ~= 3.8 s for
   the longest cascade -- a physical 64-flap reel's full revolution, kept as the
   cap even though this reel has 237 flaps). A longer jump starts its walk flapMax

/* ---- Flap set sizing ----
   A physical reel has 64 leaves because it is a physical object. These modules are DRAWN,
   so there is nothing to ration: the reel carries 237 flaps -- every printable CP1252
   glyph, the seven colour flaps, every lowercase letter, and the pictographs. It is BUILT
   AT BOOT (reelBuild in reel.h) rather than typed out, and it is not stored per module and
   not configurable -- a reel that can already draw everything has nothing left to
   reconfigure, so the physical gateway's 'N' command and flap-set editor are gone.

   The SECTION ORDER is the contract (see reel.h for the full story): the 156 uppercase
   glyph flaps and the 7 colour flaps (indices 0..162) come first, byte-compatible with
   the classic reel; the lowercase and pictograph flaps live PAST them, reachable only by
   index. On the one-byte legacy path lowercase still folds to uppercase -- it must,
   because the bytes r o y g b p w mean colours there -- while the index-addressed API
   (/api/display/cells, /api/flap/index) reaches every flap without folding.

   Flap 0 is blank (the home position).

   ONE COMPATIBILITY NOTE, deliberately accepted: the 'A' reply reports flapCount as
   SF_LEGACY_FLAPS (163), and splitflap-os (server/app.py) rejects any count outside
   1..64, so it will refuse this reel and fall back to its own map. That costs nothing
   here -- it addresses flaps BY CHARACTER ('-'), never by index, so all of its text
   still displays exactly as before. The gateway's own UI/REST/MQTT are unaffected. */
