// charset.h -- UTF-8 <-> flap-byte transcoding for the flap reel.
//
// The split-flap protocol carries exactly ONE byte per displayed character (the
// `-<char>` command is a byte, and the reel's glyph section is a byte array). Browsers and JSON, however, speak UTF-8, where a euro sign is 3
// bytes and accented letters are 2. To let people use euro signs and accented
// characters on the flaps, the gateway bridges the two: it maps each UTF-8 code
// point to a single flap byte on the way to the modules, and maps each stored flap
// byte back to UTF-8 on the way to the browser/MQTT.
//
// The single-byte flap encoding is **Windows-1252 (CP1252)**: a superset of
// Latin-1 that puts the euro sign at 0x80 and adds smart quotes, dashes, the
// ellipsis, the trademark sign, etc. in 0x80-0x9F, while keeping every
// Western-European accented letter in 0xA0-0xFF. (CP1252 is the de-facto Windows
// default, so text pasted from common tools maps cleanly.) The encoding is an
// implementation detail of charset.cpp -- callers use the neutral helpers below,
// so swapping the code page later touches only that one file.
//
// Reserved bytes that are never produced for a flap: 0x00, 0xA0 (NBSP), 0xAD
// (soft hyphen), the five CP1252 undefined slots (0x81/0x8D/0x8F/0x90/0x9D) and
// the C0/C1 control ranges. That leaves 216 printable glyphs -- exactly the
// character part of a virtual reel.
//
// 0xFF (y-diaeresis) IS a flap byte here, unlike on the physical gateway. The real
// module firmware reserves 0xFF as its "unused flap" EEPROM sentinel and so can
// never show that glyph; the virtual reel has a fixed, known length (reel.h)
// and carries it like any other character.

//
// The traps, all of which have bitten:
//   * 0xF7 is the division sign, not a letter -- its "uppercase" 0xD7 is multiplication;

//     silently turn it into an eszett;
//   * 0xDF (eszett) has no uppercase in CP1252 at all, so it keeps its own flap;
