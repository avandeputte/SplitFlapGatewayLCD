// vmodule.h -- the emulated split-flap module.
//
// One VModule stands in for one ATtiny1616 module that would otherwise hang off
// the physical gateway's serial wire. It speaks the whole protocol, byte for byte.
//
// The MECHANISM is not emulated. There is no stepper, no Hall sensor and no
// EEPROM, and nothing that can be out of tune. Every module is a flawless,
// perfectly calibrated one, and that assumption is what makes the emulation
// small:
//
//   * No calibration state, no identity beyond the wall slot, and no replies.
//     The only commands that DO anything are '-' (show character), '+' (show
//     flap index) and 'h' (home); everything else in the physical grammar
//     (calibration, dumps, the 'v'/'A' queries, by-serial addressing) is
//     silently ignored. The wall self-describes through /api/capabilities
//     and /api/display/state instead of protocol queries.
//   * No position to lose. The reel always knows where it is, so 'h' (home)
//     simply shows flap 0, the blank.
//
// What the reel does do is FLIP. Changing the displayed flap cascades forward
// through the reel one flap at a time, so the panel shows the split-flap effect
// that is the entire point of the display. That is a rendering effect, not a
// simulation: cfg.flapMax bounds how many flaps one change draws -- a longer jump
// starts the walk that many flaps short of the destination rather than trudging the
// whole way round, so the cascade stays the same length however big the reel is.
// Set flapMax to 1 for an instant cut.
//
// The reel
// --------
// 237 flaps, sectioned (the full story lives in reel.h, which defines it):
//
//   index 0        ' '                   blank (the home position)
//   index 0..155   the CP1252 repertoire in code-point order, minus lowercase
//   index 156..162 r o y g b p w         COLOUR flaps (VM_COLOUR_BASE ..)
//   index 163..222 the 60 lowercase letters      -- index-addressed only
//   index 223..236 the pictographs               -- index-addressed only
//
// The one-byte legacy path (vmFlapIndexOf) folds lowercase to uppercase and scans
// only the first 163 flaps -- it must, because the bytes r o y g b p w mean colours
// there. The index-addressed path (vmFlapIndexOfCodepoint) reaches everything.
//
// The reel is SHARED and FIXED. It is not stored per module and it is not configurable:
// a drawn reel that can already render everything has nothing left to reconfigure, so
// the physical gateway's 'N' command and flap-set editor are gone. It is built once at
// boot by vmBuildReel() (reelBuild in reel.h), rather than typed out, so it cannot
// drift from the font or from the folding rule.

// module array and the display snapshot are both INTERNAL RAM, the same pool the panel's
// framebuffer and the WiFi stack are already fighting over. At 40 bytes a module that is
