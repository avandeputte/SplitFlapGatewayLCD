// sound.h -- the speaker path (v3.6): ES8311 DAC + the onboard power amp.
//
// The board carries an ES8311 codec (I2C 0x18 on the shared bus) whose DAC feeds a
// small power amplifier (enable on GPIO 11) and speaker header. This module gives the
// gateway a voice: TONES and short NOTE SEQUENCES (chimes, alerts, game feedback),
// synthesized on-device and played over the same full-duplex I2S port the microphones
// use (audio.h). No PCM upload/playback yet -- tones cover the use cases and keep the
// surface small; samples can join later without breaking anything.
//
// Lifecycle mirrors audio.h: soundInit() runs ONCE from setup() (single-threaded I2C
// window -- see audio.h's note about rtc's raw Wire use); playback spawns a small
// synth task on demand which disables the TX channel and the amp after ~5 s idle.
// Quiet Time refuses new sounds the same way it darkens the panel.
