   THE wall. Not a model of it and not a cache of it: vmInit() creates every module from
   rows x cols, none can appear or vanish, and vmods[i].curIndex IS the flap on show. Every
   read path -- /api/display/state, /api/status, the SSE stream, the quiet-time
   snapshot -- reads it directly. There used to be a second copy of this (the module
   registry: one byte per cell), and a byte cannot name a flap on a 237-flap reel.

   Lives in INTERNAL RAM, not PSRAM: taskDisplay walks the whole array a hundred times a
   second (vmTick) on the core the panel refresh runs on, and this board's quad-SPI PSRAM
   stalls that walk long enough to wander the OE window -- an idle wall that shimmers.
   vmInit() pins it with MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL for exactly that reason. The monitor ring and
   ARE in PSRAM (gwPsramAlloc); none is walked on a 100 Hz path.
