"""Extract the translatable strings from ui/index.html into ui/strings/en.json.

The key IS the English text. That is safe here: the UI has no homographs -- every
string that repeats, or appears under a different tag, means the same thing in each
place ("Save", "Loading...", "Calibration" as both a nav link and a heading). Keying
by text means the markup needs NO data-i18n tagging, so the static page is translated
with zero edits to it.

Two runtime mechanisms, so two kinds of key:

  * TEXT NODES -- translated by a DOM walk + a MutationObserver, so this covers both
    the static markup AND the markup the JS builds later (module cards, the flap map,
    monitor rows). Nothing to wrap: the observer sees them when they are inserted.

  * t("...") -- for messages the JS COMPOSES ("Error: " + e). A DOM walk only ever
    sees the composed result ("Error: Bad JSON"), which is not a key, so these must be
    wrapped at the source.

Wrapping is CONTEXT-AWARE, never a global literal match, because JS strings that look
like prose are often code: 'nav a' is a querySelector, and 'HOME         ' is a padded
protocol decode label whose width keeps its columns aligned. Wrapping either
would break the page. Only literals inside a .textContent assignment, confirm() or
alert() are touched -- those are user-facing by construction.

Run: python3 tools/i18n_extract.py            # write ui/strings/en.json
     python3 tools/i18n_extract.py --wrap     # ALSO wrap the JS literals in t()
